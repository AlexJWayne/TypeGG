/**
 * Returns a [Color] constructed from red ([param r8]), green ([param g8]), blue ([param b8]), and optionally alpha ([param a8]) integer channels, each divided by `255.0` for their final value. Using [method Color8] instead of the standard [Color] constructor is useful when you need to match exact color values in an [Image].
 *
 * @example 
 * 
 * var red = Color8(255, 0, 0)             # Same as Color(1, 0, 0).
 * var dark_blue = Color8(0, 0, 51)        # Same as Color(0, 0, 0.2).
 * var my_color = Color8(306, 255, 0, 102) # Same as Color(1.2, 1, 0, 0.4).
 * @summary 
 * 
 *
 * **Note:** Due to the lower precision of [method Color8] compared to the standard [Color] constructor, a color created with [method Color8] will generally not be equal to the same color created with the standard [Color] constructor. Use [method Color.is_equal_approx] for comparisons to avoid issues with floating-point precision error.

/**
 * Asserts that the [param condition] is `true`. If the [param condition] is `false`, an error is generated. When running from the editor, the running project will also be paused until you resume it. This can be used as a stronger form of [method @GlobalScope.push_error] for reporting errors to project developers or add-on users.
 *
 * An optional [param message] can be shown in addition to the generic "Assertion failed" message. You can use this to provide additional details about why the assertion failed.
 *
 * **Warning:** For performance reasons, the code inside [method assert] is only executed in debug builds or when running the project from the editor. Don't include code that has side effects in an [method assert] call. Otherwise, the project will behave differently when exported in release mode.
 *
 * @example 
 * 
 * # Imagine we always want speed to be between 0 and 20.
 * var speed = -10
 * assert(speed < 20) # True, the program will continue.
 * assert(speed >= 0) # False, the program will stop.

/**
 * Returns an array with the given range. [method range] can be called in three ways:

 * `range(n: int)`: Starts from 0, increases by steps of 1, and stops **before** `n`. The argument `n` is **exclusive**.
 *
 * `range(b: int, n: int)`: Starts from `b`, increases by steps of 1, and stops **before** `n`. The arguments `b` and `n` are **inclusive** and **exclusive**, respectively.
 *
 * `range(b: int, n: int, s: int)`: Starts from `b`, increases/decreases by steps of `s`, and stops **before** `n`. The arguments `b` and `n` are **inclusive** and **exclusive**, respectively. The argument `s` **can** be negative, but not `0`. If `s` is `0`, an error message is printed.
 *
 * [method range] converts all arguments to [int] before processing.
 *
 * **Note:** Returns an empty array if no value meets the value constraint (e.g. `range(2, 5, -1)` or `range(5, 5, 1)`).
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * @example 
 * 
 * print(range(4))        # Prints [0, 1, 2, 3]
 * print(range(2, 5))     # Prints [2, 3, 4]
